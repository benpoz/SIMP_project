This is the documention for our SIMP assembler and simulator.

both the assembler and simulator are written in C.

assembler:
the assembler recieves as input a SIMP assembly program (a .asm file) and outputs an instruction memory file (imemin.txt)
and a data memory file (dmemin.txt).

the instruction file:
imemin.txt contains 


simulator:
